## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup (Local Development)

Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.x installed ([python.org](https://www.python.org/))
    *   `pip` (Python package installer)

2.  **Clone the Repository (Optional):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd ai-wardrobe-organizer
    ```
    (If you don't have a repository, just navigate to the project directory containing `app.py`)

3.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
    *   Create:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        ```
    *   Activate:
        *   Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
        *   macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Configure API Key:**
    *   Obtain a Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project (alongside `app.py`).
    *   Add your API key to this file:
        ```env
        GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    *   **Important:** Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE` with your real key. **Do not commit this file to version control if your repository is public.**

6.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    Or alternatively:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` or `http://localhost:5001/`. Check the terminal output for the exact address.

2.  **Ensure `requirements.txt` is up-to-date.**
3.  **Push your code to a Git provider** (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
4.  **Connect your Git repository to Vercel.**
5.  **Configure Environment Variables:** In your Vercel project settings, add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` as an environment variable. **Do not store the key directly in your code or `vercel.json`.**
6.  **Deploy!** Vercel should automatically build and deploy your application based on the configuration.
